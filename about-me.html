        <h2>About me</h2>
        <article>
             <p>I am a recent METU graduate with a background in architecture. Passionate about UX design and eager to learn more about the field. Interested in creating user-centered experiences that are both aesthetic and functional. Proficient in wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. Skilled in conducting user research and identifying pain points for users. My architecture education background has given me a strong understanding of space, form, and detail, which are all essential skills for UX/UI design. I am an effective communicator who can clearly and concisely explain designs to stakeholders and users.</p>
